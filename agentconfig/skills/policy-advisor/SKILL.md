# whaleshell Policy Advisor

When a request fails with `policy_denied`, do not treat the denial as final if
the user task still needs the request. Read `/etc/whaleshell/skills/policy_advisor.md`,
inspect `http://policy.local/v1/policy/current`, submit the narrowest proposal to
`http://policy.local/v1/proposals`, wait on
`/v1/proposals/{chunk_id}/wait?timeout=300`, and retry only after approval with
`policy_reloaded: true`.
